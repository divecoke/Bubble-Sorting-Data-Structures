Bubble-Sorting-Data-Structures
==============================

A school project which we chose a sorting algorithm to execute on three different data structures.

Using a dynamic int array, a list of linked int arrays, and a basic singly-linked list we were to invoke
a sort algorithm of our choosing (I chose BubbleSort, don't ask why) on each data structure in a client class
and check after each sort that the structure is indeed sorted.

See the attached .docx file for the exact instructions from our professor.
